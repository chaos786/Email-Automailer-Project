# Email-Automailer-Project

The idea is to make certain html documents to shape the mail that has to be sent and to write those mails in a way which enables the mails to be personalized. 

Using these html documents, we shall try to make a GUI which enables the layman to be able to send those mails using the Tkinter library in Python to make the GUI, and while using smtplib and a few other libraries to be able to access the email ID of the user. The IDs of the receivers will be stored in a .csv file, along with a few other details (which will be used during personalizing of the mails). 

The project includes .html file types for the templates,  2 .py file types- starter_mail.py defines the mailing function, while automater.py creates the GUI and imports and calls starter mail function, it also includes a few .css file types to style the .html documents, and 1 .csv file to store the details of the receivers.
